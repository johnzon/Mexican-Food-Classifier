# Mexican-Food-Classifier

The goal of "TeAmole app" is to classify 9 types of mexican mexican food by looking a picture.

Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook. Everything was coded in Google Colab, because of its GPU. I uploaded the dataset to Google Drive, so you can download it directly (the code to download it is in the notebook). For more details, the notebook includes the instructions to follow.

If you want to load the trained model, the code to download it, is in the notebook, in the " Load the checkpoint" section. I uploaded the model to my Google drive because it's bigger than 200MB.

This project is updated to be compatible with PyTorch 0.4.0

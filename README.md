# Mexican-Food-Classifier

Mexican cuisine is one of the most popular ones in the world. Being from Mexico, I’ve been lucky to taste, which I consider, one of the best cuisines in the world. You don’t need to go too far away to find a good spot and try different kind of tacos! You can find great food just walking by the streets. You should visit Mexico and enjoy these little things.

Stop by your local Mexican restaurant and you’ll probably find sky-high piles of nachos smothered in cheese and colossal fishbowl margaritas. But true Mexican food couldn’t be more different.

I have the idea to develop an AI app than can classify different types of mexican food and even give you the recipe to make it by your own! The goal of "TeAmole" is to classify 9 types of mexican mexican food by looking a picture.

Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook. Everything was coded in Google Colab, because of its GPU. I uploaded the dataset to Google Drive, so you can download it directly (the code to download it is in the notebook). For more details, the notebook includes the instructions to follow.

If you want to load the trained model, the code to download it, is in the notebook, in the "Load the checkpoint" section. I uploaded the model to my Google drive because it's bigger than 200MB.

This project is updated to be compatible with PyTorch 0.4.0

# Mexican-Food-Classifier
Image Classifier for typical mexican food

The goal of this project is to classify 9 different mexican food by looking a picture.

Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook. Everything was coded in Google Colab, because of its GPU. I uploaded the dataset to Google Drive, so you can download it directly. For more details, the notebook includes the instructions to follow.

This project is updated to be compatible with PyTorch 0.4.0
